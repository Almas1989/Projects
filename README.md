## [Page About me](https://github.com/Almas1989)

Welcome to my portfolio of data projects. This repository includes a selection of hands-on projects using SQL and Python for real-world data analysis tasks. These projects cover exploratory analysis, data cleaning, and correlation analysis‚Äîfundamental skills in the data analytics and engineering domains.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

### 1. üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)

- **Description**:  
  This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis using SQL on a structured dataset. It includes operations such as:
  - Identifying trends through grouping and filtering
  - Calculating statistical aggregates like averages, counts, and percentages
  - Using `CASE` statements to classify data
  - Applying conditional filtering to uncover insights

  The goal was to simulate a typical data exploration workflow within a relational database before building dashboards or models.

- **Skills Practiced**: SQL querying, aggregations, conditional logic, pattern recognition

- **Technologies**: SQL (PostgreSQL-compatible)

- **File**: [Exploratory_Data_Analysis.sql](https://github.com/Almas1989/Projects/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.sql)

### 2. üé¨ Movie Correlation Project (Python)

- **Description**:  
  This Jupyter Notebook investigates how different variables (budget, gross revenue, runtime, etc.) relate to each other in a movie dataset. Steps included:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing using `pandas`
  - Visualizing distributions and relationships with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
  - Calculating correlation coefficients (Pearson) and plotting a heatmap
  - Identifying which variables strongly affect a movie‚Äôs box office success

  The notebook helps answer business questions like: "Do bigger budgets lead to higher gross?" or "Which factors most influence revenue?"

- **Skills Practiced**: Exploratory data analysis, feature correlation, data visualization, Python scripting

- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

- **File**: [Movie_Correlation_Proj.ipynb](https://github.com/Almas1989/Projects/blob/main/Movie%20Correlation%20Proj.ipynb)

### 3. üßπ SQL Data Cleaning

- **Description**:  
  A comprehensive SQL script that focuses on cleaning a messy raw dataset to make it analysis-ready. Tasks performed include:
  - Handling and replacing `NULL` values
  - Standardizing formats (e.g., date and text case)
  - Removing duplicates
  - Creating temporary clean views and applying transformation logic
  - Renaming columns for clarity and better readability

  This project reflects a common scenario in data engineering and business analytics where raw data from sources like Excel or CSV must be cleaned before use.

- **Skills Practiced**: Data cleaning, SQL scripting, formatting, NULL handling, view creation

- **Technologies**: SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL-compatible)

- **File**: [SQL_Data_Cleaning.sql](https://github.com/Almas1989/Projects/blob/main/SQL%20Data%20Cleaning.sql)
